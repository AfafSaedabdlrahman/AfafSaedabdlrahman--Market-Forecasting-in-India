# Cellular Network Performance Prediction

Welcome to the **Cellular Network Performance Prediction** project! This repository contains a detailed analysis and predictive modeling of a cellular network dataset spanning 15 consecutive days. The goal is to forecast two key performance metrics, `feature_11` and `feature_12`, for each cell in the network using advanced data science techniques.

## üìä **Project Overview**

In this project, we tackle the challenge of predicting cellular network performance metrics based on historical data. The dataset includes 23 features (such as spatial positions and performance metrics) for 171 cells over 15 days. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, we aim to improve network performance, optimize resource allocation, and reduce operational costs.

### **Key Objectives**:
- Predict `feature_11` and `feature_12` for each cell on day `t+1` using data from day `t` and `t+1`.
- Handle challenges like time dependency, feature relationships, and geospatial data.
- Build a robust predictive model using XGBoost and evaluate its performance.
