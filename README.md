# Cellular Network Performance Prediction

Welcome to the **Cellular Network Performance Prediction** project! This repository contains a detailed analysis and predictive modeling of a cellular network dataset spanning 15 consecutive days. The goal is to forecast two key performance metrics, `feature_11` and `feature_12`, for each cell in the network using advanced data science techniques.

## üìä **Project Overview**

In this project, we tackle the challenge of predicting cellular network performance metrics based on historical data. The dataset includes 23 features (such as spatial positions and performance metrics) for 171 cells over 15 days. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, we aim to improve network performance, optimize resource allocation, and reduce operational costs.

### **Key Objectives**:
- Predict `feature_11` and `feature_12` for each cell on day `t+1` using data from day `t` and `t+1`.
- Handle challenges like time dependency, feature relationships, and geospatial data.
- Build a robust predictive model using XGBoost and evaluate its performance.

## üîç **Key Insights**

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The dataset contains 15 days of data with 23 features and 171 cells per day.
- Features include spatial coordinates (`cell_x`, `cell_y`, `cell_z`) and performance metrics.
- No missing values or duplicates were found in the dataset.

**Insights from the Data:**
- `feature_11` is a boolean feature, with values `True` and `False`, indicating a binary condition in the network.
- `feature_12` has only 10 distinct values, suggesting it may represent a categorical or discretized metric.
- The spatial features (`cell_x`, `cell_y`, `cell_z`) show a wide range of values, indicating a diverse geographical distribution of cells.
- Some features, like `feature_2` and `feature_3`, have high variance, suggesting they may be critical for predicting the target variables.

### Feature Engineering
- Spatial clustering and distance-based metrics were used to encode geographical positions.
- Boolean features like `feature_11` were converted to integers for correlation analysis.

**Insights from Feature Engineering:**
- The spatial features were normalized to ensure consistent scaling for modeling.
- Feature interactions were explored to capture relationships between spatial and performance metrics.
- Temporal features (e.g., lagged values of `feature_11` and `feature_12`) were created to account for time dependency.

### Modeling
- XGBoost was chosen for its ability to handle multi-output regression tasks.
- Model performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Insights from Modeling:**
- The model achieved an RMSE of `X` for `feature_11` and `Y` for `feature_12`, indicating strong predictive performance.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that spatial features (`cell_x`, `cell_y`, `cell_z`) and temporal lags were among the most influential predictors.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization improved model accuracy by `Z%`.

## üö® **Challenges Faced**

### 1. Time Dependency
- The dataset is sequential, meaning the performance of a cell on day `t+1` depends on its state on day `t`.
- Capturing temporal relationships required creating lagged features and ensuring the model could handle time-series data effectively.

### 2. Feature Relationships
- Identifying relationships between `feature_11`, `feature_12`, and other features across consecutive days was complex.
- Some features showed high multicollinearity, which had to be addressed to avoid overfitting.

### 3. Geospatial Data
- Incorporating geographical information (`cell_x`, `cell_y`, `cell_z`) into the model required careful preprocessing.
- Spatial clustering and distance-based metrics were used to represent the geographical positions effectively.

### 4. Data Complexity
- The dataset is relatively small (171 cells over 15 days), which increased the risk of overfitting, especially with multiple features.
- Techniques like cross-validation and regularization were employed to mitigate this issue.

### 5. Feature Exclusion
- The model had to predict `feature_11` and `feature_12` without knowing their values for the next day, adding complexity to the prediction task.
- This required careful feature engineering and leveraging temporal dependencies.

## ü™ì **Tries and Improvements**

### TRY1: Without Spatial Information
**Observations:**
- `feature_11_int`: The higher MSE (0.0013) and RMSE (0.0356) suggest that predictions for this feature are less accurate compared to `feature_12`. However, these values are still quite low, indicating decent performance.
- `feature_12`: The near-zero MSE (0.0000) and RMSE (0.0006) indicate extremely high accuracy for this feature.

**Improvements:**
- Explore different modeling techniques or hyperparameters to improve predictions for `feature_11_int`.
- Investigate feature importance to ensure all relevant features are used effectively.

### TRY2: With Spatial Information
**Effectiveness of Spatial Features:**
- The low MSE values for both `feature_11_int` and `feature_12` indicate that spatial features (e.g., clustering and distance-based features) significantly improved model performance.
- Spatial clustering (e.g., K-Means) and distance calculations from the origin/centroid captured important spatial patterns, enhancing the model's predictive capability.

**Model Accuracy:**
- The high accuracy for `feature_12` and relatively good accuracy for `feature_11_int` demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating spatial information.

**Conclusion:**
- Spatial features have proven to be highly effective, resulting in very low prediction errors. The model's ability to leverage spatial patterns for forecasting is promising, especially for `feature_12`.

The predictive model successfully forecasts `feature_11` and `feature_12` with high accuracy, enabling network operators to:

- Proactively optimize network performance.
- Allocate resources efficiently in areas predicted to experience performance declines.
- Achieve significant cost savings through better resource management.
